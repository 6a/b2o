I comissioned an artist on [fiverr][1] ([aishdesigner][2]) to create a logo for Blade II Online. While it's not exactly a masterpiece, it was very cheap and it works as a placeholder for now.

Ideally I would replace this with a higher fidelity recreation later on in the project, but I may not have time to do that.
